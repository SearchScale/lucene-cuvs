# Lucene CuVS Integration

This is an integration for [CuVS](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuvs), GPU
accelerated vector search library from NVIDIA (formerly part of [Raft](https://github.com/rapidsai/raft)),
into [Apache Lucene](https://github.com/apache/lucene).

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

As an initial integration, the CuVS library is plugged in as an IndexSearcher.
This project has two layers:

1. Java/JNI layer in the `lucene` directory.
2. CuVS/C++ layer in the `cuda` directory.

By way of a working example, OpenAI's Wikipedia corpus (25k documents) can be
indexed, each document having a content vector. A provided sample query
(query.txt) can be executed after the indexing.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is not production ready yet.

## üöÄ Benchmarks

Wikipedia (768 dimensions, 1M vectors):

|                                | Indexing   | Improvement | Search | Improvement |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------- |
| CuVS (RTX 4090, NN_DESCENT)    | 38.80 sec  |  **25.6x**  |  2 ms  |   **4x**    |
| CuVS (RTX 2080 Ti, NN_DESCENT) | 47.67 sec  |  **20.8x**  |  3 ms  |   **2.7x**  |
| Lucene HNSW (Ryzen 7700X, single thread)      | 992.37 sec |       -     |  8 ms  |      -      |

Wikipedia (2048 dimensions, 1M vectors):

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Setup

Install Nix and enable flake support. The new experimental nix installer does
this for you: <https://github.com/NixOS/experimental-nix-installer>

Install [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) and add the `direnv hook` to your
`.bashrc`:

```bash
nix profile install nixpkgs#direnv

# For hooks into shells other than bash see https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html.
echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc

source ~/.bashrc
```

Now clone `lucene-cuvs`, `cd` into it and run `direnv allow`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com/SearchScale/lucene-cuvs
cd lucene-cuvs
direnv allow
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to use `direnv` you can use `nix develop` manually which is
> the command that `direnv` would automatically call for you.

Now run the example:

```bash
bazel run lucene
```

The above command will fetch the dataset, build the CUDA and Java code and run
a script which invokes a search on the dataset:

```bash
Dataset file used is: /xxx/external/_main~_repo_rules~dataset/file/dataset.zip
Index of vector field is: 5
Name of the vector field is: content_vector
Number of documents to be indexed are: 25000

## ü•æ Next steps

Instead of extending the IndexSearcher, create a [KnnVectorFormat](https://github.com/apache/lucene/blob/main/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/codecs/KnnVectorsFormat.java)
and corresponding KnnVectorsWriter and KnnVectorsReader for tighter integration.
